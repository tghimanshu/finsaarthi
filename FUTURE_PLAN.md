# Future Plan

This document outlines the roadmap for Phase 2 of the Finsaarthi project. Phase 1 focused on establishing the static web presence. Phase 2 aims to enhance functionality, interactivity, and content management.

## Phase 2: Enhancements and Features

### 1. Dynamic Content Management
-   **CMS Integration:** Move away from hardcoded HTML content. Integrate a Headless CMS (like Strapi, Contentful, or Sanity) or convert the site to a Static Site Generator (like Jekyll, Hugo, or Next.js) to allow non-technical team members to update content, events, and blog posts easily.
-   **Blog Section:** Implement a fully functional blog to share financial tips, news, and articles. This was a placeholder in the original template.

### 2. Backend Integration
-   **Contact Form Handling:** Replace the third-party static form service with a dedicated backend (Node.js/Express, Python/Django, or PHP) to handle form submissions, send emails, and store inquiries in a database.
-   **User Authentication:** If "E-Learning" and "Gamification" features are to be personalized, implement user signup/login functionality.

### 3. E-Learning Platform
-   **LMS Integration:** Develop or integrate a Learning Management System (LMS) to host courses, quizzes, and certifications.
-   **Course Catalog:** specific pages for browsing and enrolling in courses.

### 4. Interactive Features
-   **Gamification:** Implement the "Gamification" section mentioned in the menu. This could involve financial quizzes, simulation games, and leaderboards.
-   **Events Calendar:** Add a dynamic calendar to showcase upcoming workshops and webinars.

### 5. Performance and SEO Optimization
-   **SEO Audits:** Optimize meta tags, keywords, and content for better search engine visibility.
-   **Performance Tuning:** Minify CSS/JS assets, optimize images (WebP format), and implement lazy loading to improve page load speeds.

### 6. Analytics
-   **Google Analytics:** Integrate Google Analytics or a privacy-focused alternative to track visitor traffic and behavior.

### 7. Accessibility
-   **WCAG Compliance:** Ensure the website meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to be accessible to users with disabilities (screen reader support, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios).
